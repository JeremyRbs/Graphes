# Tkinter expansion

### Python framework that is heavily inspired by JavaFX and makes creating apps easier

# Big and relax update!
### In this update tkinter_expansion received bug and performance fixes!

Bugs killed:
> Loading widgets other than 1st widget caused removing widget data when selecting widget

> Error when widget didn't support specific data, for example `activebackground`

Features added:
> Now binding help is much better `tkinter_expansion.bind_help()` 
Required parameters: panel - widget where show help, text - help message, timeout - show help message after set time in ms

> Binding widget to Designer is much comfortable with `designer.bind()` this method requires widget variable what you want to bind

> If you rather want to bind multiple widgets at one you can also use `designer.bind_all()` this method require list that contains widgets that you want to bind to Designer 

> Loading theme is much more comfortable and extreme line saving
when loading theme with `designer.load()` will require dictionary containing:
`theme_widget_name: widget_var` or `theme_widget_name: [widget_var1, widget_var2]` to apply same widget theme to different widgets

Recommendations:
> If you want to make life easier add `name="widget_name"` to widget to have easier theme loading
